    • ENVIROMENT:- ANACONDA NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE .
    • DATASET :- SALES.CSV FILE .(976 entries of sales and customer
       coffe purchesd) 
      
    • REQUIREMENTS ARE DATA SET OF COFFEE SALES I.E .CSV FILE OF THE SALES REPORT .

 NOW WITH THE HELP OF ALL REQUIRED DATA ,PLATFORM ,&SOFTWARE ;
 WE ARE DOING THE COFFE SALES ANALYSIS 

 HERE FIRSTLY WE ARE CREATING OUR JUPYTER FILE NAMED ;
COFFEE-SALES- ANALYSIS
 
NOW WE ARE USING THE PYTHON LANGUAGE  AND SOME LIBRARIES OF THAT SUCH AS PANDAS ,NUMPY,MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT ,SEABORN .

 NOW WITH THE USE OF ABOVE LIBRARIES PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONS WE FETCHED OUR DATASET , NOW WE ARE PERFORMING OUR ANALYSIS .

BY USING THE PLT. WE ARE CREATING OUR DATASETS VISUALIZATION THAT IS DATA VISUALIZATION OF OUR DATASET AND OPERATIONS 

BY USING THE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS (PROPERTIES ) 
OF LIBRARIES WE ARE OPERATING DATA AND PERFORMING THE ANALYSIS BAESD OPERATIONS ON DATASET FOR THE ANALYTICAL & DESIRED OUTPUT .

HERE WE VISUALIZED OUR DATA IN THE FORM OF BARPLOT,SCATTERPLOT,PICHART.

WE BASICALLY DID THE DATA ANALYSING ,VISUALIZATION & CLEANING WITH HELP OF ABOVE TECNIQUES AND TECNOLOGY ABOVE MENTIONED AND WE CREATED ANALYSIS REPORT OF COFEE SALES .
